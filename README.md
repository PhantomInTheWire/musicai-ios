# Music.ai

**Music.ai** is a SwiftUI-based music app for iOS and macOS that simulates AI-powered music generation and playback. It offers an intuitive interface for creating and playing music with visual effects.

The app features an AI music generation interface where users enter prompts, followed by audio playback controls including play, pause, skip, and seek. Visual elements like waveforms and progress bars enhance the experience, along with loading animations during music generation.

At its core, the app uses SwiftUI for building views. The main entry point is `Music_aiApp.swift`, which launches `ContentView` in a navigation structure. `GreetingView` handles the initial prompt input, `LoadingAnimationView` simulates generation with progress, and `PlayerView` manages playback via the `AudioManager` class using `AVFoundation`.

Audio integration loads MP3 files, supports volume and seeking, and includes delegate methods for completion. The design maintains a consistent purple/blue gradient theme with animations and modular components for smooth user interaction.
